* NES Hardware

* Software
* TODOS
** Fix Disassembler
*** TODO The disassembler is being rendered with the correct addresses, but the instruction (Opcode and Operands) are showing incorrectly (BRK)
** CPU6502.cs
*** Finish adding all address modes to the disassembler loader
** Sprite.cs
*** TODO Refactor as it is a common class and not NES specific.
*** 
** Application Storage and Testroms
*** Need a way to simply loading and saving test roms into the application data (currently the setup is not obvious).
** PPU Register Enums
*** TODO Choose better names for the enumerations - the current ones are way to obscure
** Disassembler
*** TODO Show Current/Total cycles per instruction
